# üî• Enable REAL Instagram Scraping

## Current Status: MOCK DATA ACTIVE
Your Instagram scraping is currently returning **mock data** because real Instagram credentials are not configured. This guide will help you enable **real Instagram data scraping**.

## üö® CRITICAL WARNING
**NEVER use your personal Instagram account for scraping!**
- Instagram actively monitors for automation
- Your account could be suspended or banned
- Always use a dedicated throwaway account

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Setup

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Dedicated Instagram Account
1. **Go to [instagram.com](https://instagram.com)**
2. **Click "Sign up"**
3. **Use throwaway details:**
   - Email: `scraper2024@tempmail.com` (use any temp email service)
   - Username: `cyberscraper2024` (or similar)
   - Password: Strong password (save it!)
   - Phone: Use a secondary number if available

4. **Complete the profile:**
   - Add a profile picture
   - Write a simple bio
   - Make it look like a real account

5. **Let it age:** Wait 24-48 hours before heavy scraping

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Your Environment
1. **Open your `.env` file** in the Flask backend directory
2. **Find these lines:**
   ```env
   INSTAGRAM_USERNAME=your_instagram_username
   INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD=your_instagram_password
   ```

3. **Replace with your dedicated account:**
   ```env
   INSTAGRAM_USERNAME=cyberscraper2024
   INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD=your_actual_password
   ```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Restart Your Flask Server
1. **Stop the current server** (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. **Start it again:**
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```
3. **Watch the logs** - you should see authentication messages

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Real Scraping is Active

#### Test 1: Check Status
```bash
GET /api/instagram/status
```
**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "status": "configured",
  "api_client_initialized": true,
  "data_mode": "real_api",
  "message": "Instagram API ready for scraping"
}
```

#### Test 2: Scrape a Profile
```bash
GET /api/instagram/profile/instagram
```
**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "scraping_status": {
    "data_type": "real",
    "message": "Connected to Instagram API",
    "source": "Instagram API",
    "using_real_api": true
  },
  "posts": [/* REAL Instagram posts with actual data */]
}
```

## üîç How to Tell if Real Scraping is Working

### ‚úÖ Real Instagram Data:
- **Captions:** Actual Instagram post captions
- **Images:** Real Instagram image URLs (not placeholder links)
- **Engagement:** True like/comment counts
- **Timestamps:** Actual posting dates and times
- **User Info:** Real follower counts and verification status
- **URLs:** Links to actual Instagram posts
- **Status Message:** "Connected to Instagram API"

### üìã Mock Data (Current):
- **Captions:** Generic samples like "Coffee break thoughts ‚òï"
- **Images:** Placeholder URLs like `via.placeholder.com`
- **Engagement:** Random numbers that change each request
- **Timestamps:** Recent fake dates
- **User Info:** Fake follower counts
- **URLs:** Mock URLs like `instagram.com/p/mock_1234/`
- **Status Message:** "Using mock data - Instagram credentials not configured"

## üß™ Test Script

Run this to test your setup:
```bash
python test_instagram_scraping.py
```

This will show you:
- Current credential status
- Instagram API connection status
- Sample of scraped data
- Whether you're getting real or mock data

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: Authentication Failed
**Symptoms:** Still getting mock data after setting credentials
**Solutions:**
- Double-check username/password in `.env`
- Make sure account isn't suspended
- Disable 2FA on scraping account
- Try a different account

### Problem: Account Restricted
**Symptoms:** Login works but scraping fails
**Solutions:**
- Let the account age longer
- Add more profile content
- Follow some accounts manually
- Reduce scraping frequency

### Problem: Rate Limited
**Symptoms:** Scraping works but becomes slow/errors
**Solutions:**
- Reduce request frequency
- Add longer delays between requests
- Use different accounts for different tasks
- Scrape during off-peak hours

## üöÄ Advanced Tips for Success

### Account Management:
- **Age your accounts:** Let new accounts sit for days before use
- **Look human:** Post content, follow accounts, like posts occasionally
- **Use multiple accounts:** Rotate between different scraping accounts
- **Monitor health:** Watch for warnings or restrictions

### Technical Optimization:
- **Use proxies:** Residential proxies work best
- **Random delays:** Don't scrape too regularly
- **Respect limits:** Start small and gradually increase
- **Handle errors:** Gracefully handle private accounts, rate limits

### Security Best Practices:
- **Separate everything:** Use different email, phone, IP if possible
- **Never link to main account:** Don't follow your main account
- **Keep credentials secure:** Never commit them to version control
- **Monitor activity:** Watch for Instagram notifications
