# Content Analysis 500 Error Fix

## Problem
The content analysis endpoint was returning HTTP 500 errors when trying to analyze selected content. This was caused by the activity tracking integration I added, which was failing due to missing database tables or import issues.

## Root Cause
The error was occurring because:
1. The `case_activities` table might not exist in the database
2. The activity tracker was being imported without proper error handling
3. Missing logger import in the content analysis routes

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Added Robust Error Handling**
- Added proper try-catch blocks around activity tracking
- Added ImportError handling for missing activity tracker
- Added table existence checks before attempting to create activities

### 2. **Fixed Missing Imports**
- Added logger import to content analysis routes
- Added proper error handling for activity tracker imports

### 3. **Made Activity Tracking Optional**
- Activity tracking now gracefully fails if the table doesn't exist
- Added table existence checks in the activity tracker service
- Content analysis will work even if activity tracking fails

## Files Modified

### 1. **flask_backend/routes/content_analysis.py**
```python
# Added logger import
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Added robust error handling for activity tracking
try:
    from services.activity_tracker import activity_tracker
    # ... activity tracking code ...
except ImportError as e:
    logger.warning(f"Activity tracker not available: {str(e)}")
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"Failed to track content analysis activity: {str(e)}")
```

### 2. **flask_backend/routes/osint.py**
```python
# Added robust error handling for investigation tracking
try:
    from services.activity_tracker import activity_tracker
    # ... activity tracking code ...
except ImportError as e:
    logger.warning(f"Activity tracker not available: {str(e)}")
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"Failed to track investigation activity: {str(e)}")
```

### 3. **flask_backend/services/activity_tracker.py**
```python
# Added table existence checks
def track_investigation_activity(self, ...):
    try:
        # Check if CaseActivity table exists
        inspector = db.inspect(db.engine)
        if 'case_activities' not in inspector.get_table_names():
            self.logger.warning("case_activities table does not exist, skipping activity tracking")
            return None
        # ... rest of the method ...
```

## Testing

### 1. **Test Content Analysis Endpoint**
```bash
# Run the test script
cd flask_backend
python test_content_analysis.py
```

### 2. **Check Backend Logs**
The backend will now log warnings instead of crashing:
```
WARNING: Activity tracker not available: No module named 'services.activity_tracker'
WARNING: case_activities table does not exist, skipping activity tracking
```

### 3. **Verify Content Analysis Works**
- Content analysis should now work without 500 errors
- Activity tracking will be skipped gracefully if not available
- All existing functionality remains intact

## Database Setup (Optional)

If you want to enable activity tracking, run:

```bash
cd flask_backend
python create_case_activities_table.py
```

This will create the `case_activities` table if it doesn't exist.

## Benefits of This Fix

1. **✅ Content Analysis Works** - No more 500 errors
2. **✅ Graceful Degradation** - Activity tracking is optional
3. **✅ Backward Compatibility** - Existing functionality preserved
4. **✅ Future-Proof** - Activity tracking can be enabled later
5. **✅ Better Error Handling** - Proper logging and error messages

## Status
- ✅ Content analysis endpoint fixed
- ✅ Activity tracking made optional
- ✅ Error handling improved
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

The content analysis should now work without 500 errors, and activity tracking will be enabled automatically once the database table is created.
