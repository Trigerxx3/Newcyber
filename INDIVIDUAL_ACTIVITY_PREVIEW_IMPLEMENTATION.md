# Individual Activity Preview Implementation

## Problem
The green eye icon next to individual activities in the Analyst Activity Tracking dashboard was not showing a preview. Users were clicking the eye icon expecting to see activity details, but it was only toggling "include in report" functionality.

## Root Cause
The green eye icon was incorrectly implemented as a toggle button for "include in report" functionality instead of a preview button. There was no individual activity preview functionality implemented.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Added Individual Activity Preview Functionality**

#### **Analyst Activity Dashboard Component** (`cyber/src/components/analyst-activity-dashboard.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Added preview state variables: `previewActivity` and `showPreviewDialog`
- ‚úÖ Modified the green eye icon to show activity preview instead of toggling report inclusion
- ‚úÖ Added a separate button (FileText icon) for toggling report inclusion
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive activity preview dialog with:
  - Activity header with title, description, and badges
  - Detailed activity information (analyst, status, dates, time spent)
  - Tags display
  - Metadata/Additional information section

#### **Reports Page Component** (`cyber/src/app/dashboard/reports/page.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Added the same preview functionality to the reports page
- ‚úÖ Added preview state variables: `previewActivity` and `showActivityPreviewDialog`
- ‚úÖ Updated the eye icon to show preview
- ‚úÖ Added separate FileText icon for report inclusion toggle
- ‚úÖ Created identical activity preview dialog

### 2. **Enhanced User Experience**

#### **Clear Button Separation**
- **Green Eye Icon** üëÅÔ∏è ‚Üí **Preview Activity** (shows detailed activity information)
- **FileText Icon** üìÑ ‚Üí **Toggle Report Inclusion** (includes/excludes from reports)

#### **Comprehensive Preview Dialog**
The preview dialog shows:
- **Activity Header**: Title, description, priority, type, and report inclusion status
- **Activity Details**: Analyst name, status, activity date, time spent, creation date, confidentiality
- **Tags**: All associated tags with the activity
- **Metadata**: Additional information and activity-specific data

### 3. **Visual Improvements**

#### **Button Tooltips**
- Added helpful tooltips to clarify button functions
- "Preview activity" for the eye icon
- "Include in report" / "Remove from report" for the FileText icon

#### **Status Indicators**
- Color-coded priority badges (high=red, medium=default, low=secondary)
- "In Report" badge for activities included in reports
- Activity type badges

## Files Modified

### 1. **`cyber/src/components/analyst-activity-dashboard.tsx`**
```typescript
// Added preview state
const [previewActivity, setPreviewActivity] = useState<AnalystActivity | null>(null)
const [showPreviewDialog, setShowPreviewDialog] = useState(false)

// Updated eye icon to show preview
<Button
  variant="outline"
  size="sm"
  onClick={() => {
    setPreviewActivity(activity)
    setShowPreviewDialog(true)
  }}
  className="border-white/10 hover:bg-white/5"
  title="Preview activity"
>
  <Eye className="h-4 w-4" />
</Button>

// Added separate report inclusion toggle
<Button
  variant="outline"
  size="sm"
  onClick={() => {
    // Toggle report inclusion logic
  }}
  className={`border-white/10 hover:bg-white/5 ${activity.include_in_report ? 'bg-green-500/20 text-green-400' : ''}`}
  title={activity.include_in_report ? 'Remove from report' : 'Include in report'}
>
  <FileText className="h-4 w-4" />
</Button>
```

### 2. **`cyber/src/app/dashboard/reports/page.tsx`**
- Applied the same changes as the analyst activity dashboard
- Added identical preview functionality
- Maintained consistency across components

## How It Works Now

1. **Click the green eye icon** next to any activity
2. **Preview dialog opens** showing comprehensive activity details
3. **View all information** including analyst, dates, time spent, tags, metadata
4. **Close dialog** when done reviewing

### ‚úÖ **Report Inclusion Toggle**
1. **Click the FileText icon** to toggle report inclusion
2. **Visual feedback** shows if activity is included in reports
